## 2. Customer Retention
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

Task : 
- Define proper KPIs
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs. 
- Give explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

#### Explanation Findings
- Two Measure reasons our Competitors wins are better devices and better offer, so Build strong technology & Infrastructure to offer fast, quality digital experience.
- Customers subscripted to Online Security and Premium Tech Support are far less likely to chum compare to those didn't. So suggest give away free 3 Months Security and Tech Support subscription to existing customers, as this could help Customers Stay.
- Company should come with differentiated offering for all customer type, like 1st time customer/high value customer/loyal customers etc
- Company should come with more attractive longer term subscription plans rather than focusing on monthly plans.

## 3. Diversity Inclusion
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, 
but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.
At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents 
and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. 
We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:
# of men
# of women
# of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover 
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women
